.. _install-via_pip:

Installing lcoally with via pip
===============================

In the future, ``pyEPR`` can be installed using the Python package manager `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_.


However, for the moment, we recommend a local develper instalation, which allows for fast upgrades. We are still in active development.
Perform the steps in the :ref:`install-main` section.
What you could do, once you have the local clone git, is to install pyEPR locally. Navigate to the local root folder of the repo.

First, in bash, upgrade python ``pip``

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install -U pip

Now we can locally install the pyEPR module.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -e .


.. _install-via_conda:

Installing via conda
====================

For Python 3.6+, installation via conda will be supported in a future version.


In the meantime, if you are using conda, you can locally install from the cloned repo.
Perform the steps in the :ref:`install-main` section.
Now, you can use

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install -e .
